# Eurozone Archive (English Edition)

This repository contains English translations of 20 public-facing articles originally written in 2025, during Bulgaria's public debate on euro adoption.

Each article addresses a frequently asked question or widespread concern — ranging from prices and salaries to sovereignty, disinformation, and democratic legitimacy. The texts were first published in a public newsletter and social media campaign, offered freely as a civic initiative.

This archive is not a political endorsement of the euro. It is a record of how facts, dialogue, and transparency can help societies navigate uncertainty.
