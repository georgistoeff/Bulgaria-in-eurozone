# #9 What will happen to budgetary discipline? (Part 2)

**28 March 2025**

The risk of deteriorating budgetary discipline after Bulgaria transitions from a currency board to euro area membership is, in my view, perhaps the most important risk we need to analyze. This concern is also widely shared among colleagues in economic policy.

As one macroeconomist colleague put it:

> “In the euro area, the government will be able—just like others—to easily run deficits above 3%. I’m convinced that this is why the currency board is seen as an obstacle by many politicians, and why they are so eager to move to the euro…”
> 

The concern here is that the government may slip into a pattern of irresponsible spending and eventually into a debt spiral. The exact consequences are unpredictable, but possible outcomes range from mild to severe crises.

### In a milder scenario:

Markets would react early and "punish" an imprudent government by making debt servicing difficult. The country would turn to the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), receive support, and enter a financial rescue program. This would entail unpopular but targeted measures to restore fiscal balance. Looking at the current state of Bulgaria's budget, such a program would likely be more painful for certain political actors and interest groups than for the general public.

### In a more severe scenario:

We could see a "Greece 2.0" situation—where banks heavily exposed to government debt must be rescued, requiring a broader and harsher program, including pension or welfare cuts. While such an outcome is less likely—Europe has learned from the Greek crisis—it cannot be ruled out.

But there are two key points we must not overlook when evaluating these risks:

### 1. These scenarios are also possible **under the lev**.

Counting on permanent political consensus for sound fiscal policy is wishful thinking. [As Krassen Stanchev notes](https://www.svobodnaevropa.bg/a/kakvo-prechi-na-bulgaria-da-stigne-do-evrozonata/33290408.html?fbclid=IwY2xjawJTJBxleHRuA2FlbQIxMAABHX4ITHrcdk-h9dd5TG7bvO_4DIdklSerIW17OO7MsBtJiP39YF5oRHsrKA_aem_-2qlWkxHCc3Vu-m4CoFBHQ), since 2020 Bulgaria has dismantled its fiscal rules, which had capped the budget deficit at 2% of GDP, spending at 40% of GDP, and required deficits to be temporary. This marked a fundamental shift in governance philosophy.

### 2. A fiscal crisis **under the euro** would not destroy the currency.

This is a critical difference. A debt crisis under the lev—such as in 1996–1997—would destroy the national currency itself. A crisis in the eurozone would not. The lev would disappear; the euro would not. A functioning money system is essential to keeping society—especially a free society—intact.

So yes, **there is a risk** of fiscal irresponsibility. But this risk exists both now and in a euro-based future.

Where does the **moral hazard** lie?

In theory, it comes from any mechanism that softens the market’s reaction to risky fiscal behavior—such as regulatory treatment of government bonds or ECB interventions. This might give politicians a false sense of safety. The real danger is when this false confidence combines with tools like the ESM, which would step in to rescue a small economy like Bulgaria. But a rescue only comes with strings attached: **a strict fiscal adjustment program**, possibly including privatisations and external supervision of budget policy.

In other words, any politician hoping for “free money” may soon discover they’ve traded budgetary discretion for foreign oversight. If our leaders fail to grasp that risk, then the very **loss of sovereignty** they fear may end up protecting us from their own short-sightedness.

Finally, let us be absolutely clear: **neither the ECB nor the BNB can finance the government directly**. EU law prohibits all forms of monetary financing—central banks cannot fund public deficits or grant privileged market access to public institutions.

As now, the Bulgarian government will continue to have access only to the funds it holds in its own BNB accounts—roughly, the fiscal reserve. The BNB cannot increase these balances, offer grants, or take on liabilities on behalf of the government.
