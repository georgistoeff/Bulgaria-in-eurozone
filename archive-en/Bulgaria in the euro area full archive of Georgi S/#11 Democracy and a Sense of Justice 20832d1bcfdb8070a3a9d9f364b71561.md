# #11 Democracy and a Sense of Justice

6 April 2025

Beyond technical concerns, many questions I’ve received touch on the democratic legitimacy of decisions related to Bulgaria’s path toward euro area membership. I believe this is a critical and sensitive topic—particularly in a period marked by growing doubts not only about the rule of law, but also about the integrity of Bulgaria’s constitutional order. I’ll risk sounding more opinionated than usual, because some of the next posts will explore broader issues of “sovereignty,” and it helps to begin with a few foundations regarding democracy.

Here’s a representative question:

> “Over 65% of people are against joining the eurozone—this is a democracy. Isn’t that enough to settle the matter?”
> 

This concern is likely based on polling data. But much depends on how the question was asked. For example, many who say they support “keeping the lev” may not realize that the lev today exists only under a currency board arrangement—that is, it is a proxy for the euro. If they want to *truly* restore the lev as a sovereign currency, the only way to do that is to abolish the currency board and create a new monetary regime.

So the more technically accurate question to ask in a poll would be:

**“Would you support abolishing the currency board in order to restore the lev as a fully sovereign Bulgarian currency?”**

If such data exists, I would welcome the opportunity to comment on it in a future post.

Of course, the credibility of any polling result also depends on the neutrality and professionalism of the agency conducting it. But for now, I’d focus your attention on the phrasing of the question itself—because it’s key to gauging whether Bulgarians *actually* oppose the euro, or simply do not fully understand what the lev is under the current regime.

Let’s also remember: Bulgarians are already using the euro—not in name, but in function. The euro is the reserve currency of the lev. And no one has ever asked them,

> “Would you like to part with the euro?”
> 

That question might give a more accurate sense of public sentiment.

In fact, what current polling often reflects is not a rejection of the euro as a currency, but skepticism toward the euro *area* as a political integration step—much like earlier skepticism toward joining the EU itself. This raises a further question:

> “In Slovakia and Hungary, there’s talk of holding referenda on leaving the EU. Meanwhile, in Bulgaria we don’t respect public will on joining the eurozone…”
> 

Indeed, it is possible—and we’ve seen this in history—for fear to be weaponized against freedom and democracy. But in any mature democracy, such attempts are counterbalanced by *other* fears: the fear of tyranny, of unchecked power. Even nations with histories of authoritarianism, like many post-communist countries, eventually develop this protective reflex.

The greater risk to liberty, I believe, lies not in institutions or procedures, but in *leaders* who promise a perfect world. These charismatic figures are often embraced because “democracy is imperfect.” But this sentiment is only true for those who expect democracy to deliver utopia—a Switzerland or a Scandinavia—by default.

**Yet the true strength of democracy grounded in the rule of law is not in offering a perfect world. It is in building resilient mechanisms to prevent catastrophe.**

This is the view of Karl Popper in *The Open Society and Its Enemies*. He argues we should not judge political systems by the ideals they promise, but by the safeguards they build against abuse, arbitrariness, and tyranny.

Likewise, stable alliances between nations are grounded less in shared dreams than in shared limits—boundaries of what must *never* be allowed: aggression, economic sabotage, or the erosion of human rights.

This logic underpins enduring alliances like NATO—defensive by design and sustainable over time. It also underpins the European Union, which removes barriers to free movement and initiative, while requiring its members to uphold *democratic rule of law* as a foundational condition.

The same applies to the currency board. And it applies to joining the eurozone. These are not mechanisms for enforcing utopia. They are **constraints on political arbitrariness**—and thus reduce uncertainty for citizens.
