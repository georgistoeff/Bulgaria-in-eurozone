# #13 Are we losing national identity?

22 April 2025

When the Bulgarian lev is replaced by the euro, Bulgaria will officially become part of the euro area, and Bulgarian identity will be represented within the common currency. Below is a brief overview of how Bulgarian national symbols will be preserved and incorporated into the euro currency itself.

Euro coins have two sides: a **common side** depicting symbols of Europe, and a **national side** representing the issuing country. (You can see examples of euro coins in the comments below and compare them with Bulgaria’s current coins.)

Here’s what will appear on the national side of Bulgarian euro coins:

- **2-euro coin:** Depicts St. Paisius of Hilendar. On the right side, in Cyrillic script, it says **“BULGARIA”**. On the left side, there is the Cyrillic inscription **“EURO”** and the year of issue. Additionally, the edge of the 2-euro coin will bear the Bulgarian motto **“GOD SAVE BULGARIA”** ("БОГ ДА ПАЗИ БЪЛГАРИЯ").
- **1-euro coin:** Depicts St. Ivan of Rila, Bulgaria’s patron saint. The right side includes the Cyrillic inscription **“BULGARIA”**, while the left side shows **“EURO”** and the year of issue, also in Cyrillic.
- **50, 20, 10, 5, 2, and 1-cent coins:** These will feature the Madara Rider, a UNESCO-listed symbol of Bulgarian heritage. At the top is the Cyrillic inscription **“BULGARIA”**, with the denomination (**“СТОТИНКА”** for 1 cent and **“СТОТИНКИ”** for 2, 5, 10, 20, and 50 cents) appearing at the bottom, along with the year of issue.

**These Bulgarian euro coins will be legal tender across the entire euro area and accepted wherever euros are used!**

Beyond these technical details, some additional clarification may be helpful. Issues of national identity are often confused with issues of nationalism. Many people could benefit from a clearer understanding of these differences:

- **Identity** is a sense of belonging—to a language, culture, customs, and shared historical memory. It can be multilayered and dynamic; a person can simultaneously feel Bulgarian, European, a parent, a professional, religious, and more.
- **Nationalism**, on the other hand, often claims exclusivity. It positions national belonging as supreme, incompatible with other identities, and seeks to draw boundaries rather than build bridges.
- While **identity** encourages understanding, openness, and coexistence, **nationalism** frequently feeds on fear and division, framing the world as “us versus them.”
- **Identity** is confident and open; it’s not afraid of interacting with other cultures. **Nationalism** is insecure, closed, defensive—even against imagined threats.
- **Identity** is constantly evolving and forward-looking; **nationalism** is often fixed on an imagined “golden past” to which society must return.
- Nationalism imposes a collective identity that subordinates individual freedom to a perceived national interest. This can lead to exclusion, xenophobia, and conflict.

We are all aware of societies—sometimes claiming to be civilized—in which a dominant idea persists: that individuals exist primarily to serve the state, rather than the state existing to serve individuals.

But nationalism is fundamentally incompatible with the principles of a free society—and therefore incompatible with genuine civilization. In a free society, people must have the freedom to define their own identities and associations without being constrained by rigid national or ethnic frameworks.
