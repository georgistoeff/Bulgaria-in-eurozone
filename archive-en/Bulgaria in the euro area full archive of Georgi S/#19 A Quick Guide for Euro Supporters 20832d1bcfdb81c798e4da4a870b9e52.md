# #19 A Quick Guide for Euro Supporters

**17 May 2025**

*How to speak objectively, respectfully, and clearly about one of Bulgaria’s most divisive economic issues*

This penultimate post is aimed specifically at those who support Bulgaria's accession to the euro area and want to advocate for it fairly, factually, and with respect for people who remain undecided. If we believe that public debate has value, it must be conducted not with slogans, but with arguments that can withstand scrutiny. That’s why strong pro-euro reasoning should be grounded not in promises of future gains, but in **structural safeguards that reduce systemic risk**.

**Most important:** Build your case around **one clear message**. You don’t need a long list of reasons to adopt the euro. Personally, I use just one:

👉 *The euro brings greater security – fewer risks, including currency risk.*

---

### **1. Avoid the “What happened in Croatia/Estonia?” trap — resist analogies and induction**

Many arguments, both for and against the euro (even among economists), are based on **inductive reasoning**—drawing general conclusions from past examples: what happened in other countries, what didn’t happen in Bulgaria yet, etc. That includes analogy-based reasoning (e.g. “look at Croatia”).

Such examples can be illustrative, but **they are not a solid foundation for risk decisions**.

> Inductive arguments are rarely sufficient when dealing with systemic risk.
> 

The future is shaped not by past outcomes, but by today’s **incentive structures and constraints**. So let’s focus on rules and boundaries—not hopes and promises.

### **2. Don’t claim the euro will bring direct benefits — most changes come through other channels**

Yes, many changes will follow euro adoption — but **most of them will not be caused by the currency itself**. Inflation, interest rates, and capital flows already affect us through the peg to the euro.

Also, remember: every promise can be easily attacked by skeptics. They only need **one counter-example** to discredit your point. You, on the other hand, will never be able to conclusively “prove” your optimism.

### **3. Don’t deny the eurozone’s risks — remind people we already live with them**

> We are not assuming new risks by joining.
> 
> 
> The **larger risks are already here**.
> 
> What we’re doing is replacing internal fragility with external safeguards.
> 

**The eurozone does not guarantee success** — but it **rules out some of the worst-case scenarios for Bulgaria**.

---

### **4. Explain the qualitative difference between risks inside and outside the eurozone**

Eurozone risks are serious — but mostly **known**: French fiscal stress, a Spanish banking issue, “another Greece”.

Bulgaria’s domestic risks are less visible but more acute:

- A simple parliamentary majority can dismantle the currency board
- It doesn’t require a crisis — just a moment of poor judgment or political expediency
- It doesn’t require bad intentions — inertia or short-term thinking is enough

> In the eurozone, risks are less personal. In Bulgaria, they often have names — they sit in parliament.

### **5. Make clear: stability comes from rules, not good intentions**

As economist Krassen Stanchev noted:

> “In 2020, Bulgaria revoked fiscal discipline rules applied since 2012 — 2% deficit ceiling, 40% spending cap, and a requirement that deficits remain exceptions. That marked a complete shift in fiscal philosophy.”
> 

**A debt or budget crisis is possible even with the lev.** But within the eurozone, such a crisis won’t destroy the currency itself. With the lev, it very well might. It already has — in 1996–97.

---

### **6. Defend the citizens, not the state**

Yes, the euro limits governments’ fiscal discretion. But in a context of **questionable budget discipline**, this is not a loss — it’s a safeguard. Not for politicians — for citizens.

> Losing “fiscal sovereignty” for the government may actually mean gaining personal sovereignty for citizens — the ability to plan life and business without fear of currency collapse.
> 

---

### **7. Via Negativa: Stability comes from constraints, not ideology**

Strong unions — of people or nations — are built not on shared utopias, but on **shared limits on what must never be allowed**: aggression, economic instability, suppression of rights.

Examples:

- **NATO**: A defensive alliance by definition
- **The EU**: Grants freedom of movement, but requires rule of law as a precondition
- **The currency board**: Limits local recklessness to protect people from repeat catastrophes
- **The eurozone**: Removes the power of national governments to print and overspend money without consequence

> Democracy does not thrive on idealism alone — it thrives on clear constraints on what should never be allowed, even by good people with good intentions.
