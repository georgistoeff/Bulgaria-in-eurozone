# #2 What Will Happen to Wages?

**1 March 2025**

I continue this series by answering more of the questions and concerns shared with me about Bulgaria’s accession to the euro area. A few questions on personal finance remain before I move on to issues of macroeconomic stability. Thank you to everyone still waiting for a response — your patience is appreciated.

The most frequently asked question in the personal finance category is “What will happen to prices?” I’ll address that early next week, once I’ve received enough related questions to group them meaningfully. Before that, however, I want to briefly respond to another common concern:

> Will my salary change when Bulgaria joins the euro area?

### ✅ Answer:

Your salary is defined in your employment contract. Unless that contract is amended, your salary will remain unchanged in real value. Starting 1 January 2026, you will receive your salary in euros, **converted at the official exchange rate of 1 EUR = 1.95583 BGN**.

For example, if your contract states that your December 2025 salary is **1,500 BGN**, and there is no contractual change, your January 2026 salary will be **766.94 EUR**.

By law, employers may round this figure **only upward**, so the actual amount paid might be **767 EUR**, but never less.

This rule applies not only to employment contracts, but to all financial obligations expressed in leva — they will be converted into euros at the fixed rate.

Note that the **net salary** (what you take home) will still be affected by tax and social security deductions. If there are changes in tax rates or contribution rules, your net salary in euros might differ slightly from the December 2025 equivalent — but this would happen **regardless of euro adoption**.

If your salary does change on 1 January 2026 or afterward, the most typical reason would be **a regular increase**, due to performance, inflation, or labor market dynamics — not because of the currency switch.

### 🧠 Be cautious about attributing changes to the euro.

Many things in our lives will change around the time of euro adoption — some for the better, some not. But the vast majority of these changes will **have nothing to do with the euro**.

Sometimes the cause of a change is obvious — for example, a negotiated raise or a missing holiday bonus. In those cases, you won’t blame the currency switch. But when the cause is unclear, it’s tempting to attribute any change to the “big national event” — the euro. **In most cases, however, there will be no connection.**

In the next article, I’ll address the most anticipated question in this series:

**“What will happen to prices?”** — and how to tell what’s caused by the euro and what isn’t.
