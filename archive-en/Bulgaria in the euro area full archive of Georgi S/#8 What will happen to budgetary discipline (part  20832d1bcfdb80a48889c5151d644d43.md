# #8 What will happen to budgetary discipline? (part 1)

**27 March 2025**

When it comes to public finances, two distinct types of concerns are commonly raised:

1. The risk of *deteriorating budgetary discipline* after Bulgaria moves from a currency board to euro area membership.
2. The *loss or curtailment of fiscal sovereignty* after joining the eurozone.

These are two opposing hypotheses. One suggests *more* fiscal freedom (and thus, more risk); the other, *less* freedom (and thus, more constraint). Interestingly, they come from different groups of citizens, each skeptical of euro adoption—but for different reasons.

In fact, I’ve received several questions that combine both concerns: people fear that euro membership may simultaneously *tie the hands* of responsible economic policy and *fail to prevent* irresponsible spending by politicians.

This type of “mixed concern” falls into a category that I will not explore in detail. It assumes a comparison between Bulgaria’s eurozone future and some *hypothetical*, radically different model—for example, a new currency board backed by gold or bitcoin, or unconstrained monetary policy executed perfectly by wise and incorruptible leaders.

In every post, my goal is to compare the *actual* risks and uncertainty of Bulgaria’s current position with those that come with eurozone membership. So the key question is this: **Does the move reduce the probability of severe policy mistakes or political arbitrariness?**

We already live with certain political risks—and we will continue to face some even in the eurozone. The difference is not merely *quantitative* (as in “Can we measure it in percent?”) but *qualitative*—the *type* of risks changes.

The direction of dangerous policy spirals is usually the same: from increased public spending → to unsustainable debt → to pressure on the value of money. In both Bulgaria and the euro area, the goal is to contain this through rules and oversight.

Currently, in Bulgaria, one key risk lies in bad faith or sheer incompetence—namely, that Parliament could abolish the currency board with a simple majority vote.

In contrast, eurozone risks are of a different nature. They are more systemic, often tied to the functioning of large economies or financial systems (France’s debt crisis, Spain’s banking sector, a hypothetical “new Greece”). These are *known unknowns*, often discussed and studied. In Bulgaria, the *unknown unknowns* are more dangerous—like drawing “41” from a roulette wheel where you thought you were betting on 5 of 35 numbers. Many of us lived through the “Videnov winter” in the 1990s, but there are still risks that do not even cross our minds.

In the next response, I will address the concrete risks associated with **Hypothesis 1**, outlined at the beginning of this post.
