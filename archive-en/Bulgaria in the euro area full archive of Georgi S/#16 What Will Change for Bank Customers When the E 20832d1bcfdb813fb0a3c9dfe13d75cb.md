# #16 What Will Change for Bank Customers When the Euro Is Introduced?

*3 May 2025*

**Guest author: Ivo Eftimov**

In response to ongoing questions from readers about what euro adoption will mean for the relationship between banks and their customers, I invited a guest contribution from **Ivo Eftimov**, a long-time banker and trusted expert.

### **What will happen to bank accounts denominated in BGN?**

All BGN accounts—whether held by individuals or businesses—will be **automatically and free of charge converted into euro**. The conversion will be made at the **fixed exchange rate of 1 EUR = 1.95583 BGN**. While the final decision on the rate is up to the EU Council, Bulgarian law mandates that the euro can only be adopted at this current fixed rate.

### **Do customers need to take any action?**

No. **The conversion will happen automatically**. IBAN account numbers will remain unchanged.

---

### **Will there be fees for this conversion?**

No. **Banks are legally prohibited from charging fees** for converting account balances to euro during the transition.

---

### **What if a customer has more than one euro account after the conversion?**

If a customer ends up with redundant euro accounts, they may choose to close any extra account **free of charge** within **two months** of the changeover. It’s a good idea to check which account is set as your **main income or payment account**.

### **How will loan interest rates change?**

- **Fixed-rate loans**: The terms will remain unchanged for the entire duration of the loan.
- **Variable-rate loans**: The base index (e.g. average deposit rate in BGN) will be replaced by a **comparable euro-based index**. However, on the **day of euro adoption**, the **total interest rate must remain the same** as the day before.

In the future, interest rates may change based on market conditions—but not because of the currency switch itself. Loan contracts typically include provisions for transparent updates to interest terms.

### **If my interest rate doubles, will my monthly installment also double?**

No. For example:

- A loan of **100,000 BGN** over **20 years** at **2.5% interest** → monthly payment: **529.90 BGN**
- The same loan at **5.0% interest** → monthly payment: **659.96 BGN**

The increase is noticeable but **not double**.

### **Isn’t it bad for banks if interest rates in Bulgaria become among the lowest in the eurozone? Don’t banks profit from high rates?**

Actually, in a **growing economy with low interest rates**, the **quality of the loan portfolio improves**—which results in **better financial outcomes** for banks. Bulgaria’s entry into the eurozone is another step in European integration. It will not, by itself, trigger dramatic or immediate economic shifts.

In reality, **macroeconomic fluctuations are influenced more by global factors**—such as political decisions, wars, pandemics—than by the act of joining the eurozone.
