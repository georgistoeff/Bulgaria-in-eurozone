# #1 Is the exchange rate 1 EUR = 1.95583 BGN

**26 February 2025**

In this newsletter, I share answers to questions and concerns I received regarding Bulgariaâ€™s accession to the euro area.

As previously outlined, the questions fall into several categories. My initial focus is on Group A â€” personal finance. After addressing the most pressing issues here, I will move on to Group B â€” macroeconomic stability.

Surprisingly, one of the most frequently asked questions has been:

> What guarantees that the current euroâ€“lev exchange rate will be preserved when Bulgaria joins the euro area?
> 

### âœ… Answer:

The fixed exchange rate of **1 EUR = 1.95583 BGN** is guaranteed by three key factors:

1. **The Currency Board Arrangement**
    
    Since 1997, Bulgaria has operated under a currency board, initially pegged to the German mark and now to the euro. Legally, every lev in circulation is fully backed by euro-denominated foreign exchange reserves. There is therefore **no technical or financial justification for any devaluation of the lev**.
    
2. **National Legislation**
    
    Bulgarian law stipulates that the lev will be replaced by the euro at the fixed rate. As part of the accession process, a specific law is adopted to confirm this rate.
    
    Changing it would require a political decision by the National Assembly â€” but such a decision would effectively amount to **rejecting eurozone membership**, as it would breach the legal framework required for entry.
    
    In short: **you cannot both join the euro area and apply a different rate.** These two conditions are mutually exclusive.
    
3. **Membership in ERM II**
    
    Since 2020, Bulgaria has been part of the Exchange Rate Mechanism II (ERM II), committing to a stable exchange rate against the euro. The agreed central rate with the European Central Bank is **1 EUR = 1.95583 BGN**.
    
    Joining the euro area formalizes this commitment and **removes the risk of unilateral political changes to the rate**.
    

Therefore, once Bulgaria officially adopts the euro, **all lev-denominated amounts will be converted at the rate of 1.95583**, without any loss of value for citizens or businesses.

### ðŸ’¬ What about exchange fees or rate differences?

Some concerns may stem from uncertainty about how the conversion will work in practice. Will people lose money due to fees or a difference between the official rate and the exchange rate used by banks?

The **Bulgarian National Bank (BNB)** has provided clear guidance. Here are key points:

- On the day of euro adoption, **all bank accounts will be converted automatically and free of charge**. From that day onward, **only euros will be available for withdrawal**, whether at ATMs, POS terminals, or bank counters.
- **Cash withdrawals from ATMs** will dispense only euro banknotes.
- **For six months after euro adoption**, all banks will be required to exchange **lev banknotes and coins into euros at the official rate**, free of charge and without limit.
- In areas without bank branches, **Bulgarian Posts (EAD)** will offer cash exchange services free of charge:
    - Up to **BGN 1,000 per person per day** without prior request;
    - Up to **BGN 10,000 per person per day** with prior request.
- The **BNB will exchange lev banknotes and coins into euros at the official rate** â€” free of charge, **in unlimited amounts and without time limitation**.
