# #12 The Digital Euro

15 April 2025

We now return to more technical topics, beginning with the digital euro. As announced earlier, I’ll continue answering your questions on money, banking, and the financial system until the end of this campaign (1 June). These topics will take priority.

What follows is a brief introduction to the digital euro. If you’d like clarification on any of the points, feel free to write to me—preferably by private message. The more we understand, the less we fear change—especially when the change is in our own interest.

### **What is the digital euro?**

The digital euro is an electronic form of the euro, issued by the European Central Bank (ECB). We will be able to use it to pay both online and offline, quickly and free of charge—just like cash, but in digital form.

---

### **Will it replace cash?**

No. The digital euro will **complement**, not replace, euro banknotes and coins. Everyone will be free to choose how they pay—cash, card, or digital euro.

---

### **Why introduce the digital euro?**

The reasons are **strategic**. Most digital payments today rely on private systems, many of them operated by companies outside the EU. The digital euro offers a **European alternative**—a payment method that is public, secure, and independent. It’s a **defensive measure** to reduce dependence on foreign technologies and shield Europe from risks beyond its control.

---

### **Who will be able to use it?**

All individuals and businesses in the euro area—including short-term visitors. Once Bulgaria joins the euro area, we too will have access to the digital euro.

---

### **How will it work in practice?**

Through a mobile app, card, or wearable device (like a smartwatch). It will support payments in shops, online, peer-to-peer (P2P), and even offline—without needing internet access.

---

### **Will it cost anything to use?**

No. The digital euro will be **free to use** for private individuals.

---

### **Will it pay interest?**

No. It is meant for **payments**, not for savings or investment. There will likely be limits on how much one can hold to avoid large-scale withdrawals from commercial banks.

---

### **What about security and privacy?**

- **Offline payments** will offer a level of **privacy similar to cash**—no data will be recorded.
- **Online payments** will **not** be visible to the ECB. Transaction data will be processed only by your payment service provider, subject to strict EU privacy rules (GDPR).

---

### **When will it launch?**

The project entered its **preparatory phase** in November 2023. The **earliest decision on implementation** will come at the **end of 2025**, once testing is complete and the necessary legal framework is in place.

---

### **What does this mean for Bulgaria?**

Although Bulgaria is not yet in the euro area, once it adopts the euro, it will **automatically gain access** to the digital euro. It will be an additional option, not an obligation. We’ll be able to choose between cash, bank accounts, and ECB-issued digital payments—with all options carrying the **same value**.
