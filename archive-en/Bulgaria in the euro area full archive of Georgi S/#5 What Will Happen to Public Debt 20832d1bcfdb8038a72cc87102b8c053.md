# #5 What Will Happen to Public Debt?

**12 March 2025**

I continue this series with questions related to **macroeconomic stability, fiscal policy, and Bulgaria‚Äôs future within the euro area**. I‚Äôve received a surprisingly large number of questions on these topics and will address them in two parts.

First, I‚Äôll focus on **concrete concerns** ‚Äî particularly about government debt, public finances, and central bank reserves.

Later, I‚Äôll explore **more abstract or strategic concerns**, such as:

> ‚ÄúWhy do countries like Denmark and Sweden refuse to join the eurozone, while Bulgaria sees it as beneficial?‚Äù
> 

Both categories deserve serious attention, but starting with the facts will allow us to build a solid foundation for discussing broader risks.

### üí¨ A frequently asked question:

> ‚ÄúWon‚Äôt Bulgaria‚Äôs external debt multiply after joining the euro area? We‚Äôre currently below 30%, while the euro area average is 85%+.‚Äù
> 

A related version of this concern:

> ‚ÄúEurozone countries have an average public debt of 88.2% of GDP, while the EU average is 81.6%. How should we interpret this?‚Äù
>

### üß© Clarifying terms ‚Äî not all "debt" is the same

Discussions around sovereign debt often conflate different concepts. Here‚Äôs a breakdown:

- **Gross external debt**: Includes debt held by both the government and private sector (banks, corporations).
    
    ‚ö†Ô∏è *This should not be confused with public debt.*
    
- **Public debt**: All financial obligations of the central government. It can be:
    - **Domestic** (owed to local institutions)
    - **External** (owed to foreign lenders)

### üìä Current debt levels (% of GDP):

| Country/Group | Public Debt |
| --- | --- |
| **Bulgaria** | 25% |
| **EU average** | 82% |
| **Eurozone average** | 88% |

According to Bulgaria‚Äôs Ministry of Finance, our government debt is currently **25% of GDP**, with a **3:1 split between external and domestic debt**.

The second question ‚Äî comparing EU vs. eurozone averages ‚Äî highlights that **non-eurozone EU countries tend to have lower debt**:

| Country | Public Debt (% of GDP) |
| --- | --- |
| Bulgaria | 25% |
| Sweden | 32% |
| Denmark | 34% |
| Czech Republic | 44% |
| Romania | 53% |
| Poland | 54% |
| Hungary | 76% |

This raises the concern that joining the eurozone might push countries toward higher government debt.

### ‚ùì Does joining the eurozone automatically increase public debt?

No.

**Sharing a common currency does not equalize fiscal behavior.**

Here‚Äôs the spread of public debt among **current euro area members**:

| Country | Public Debt (% of GDP) |
| --- | --- |
| Greece | 158% |
| Italy | 136% |
| France | 114% |
| Belgium | 106% |
| ... | ... |
| Ireland | 42% |
| Lithuania | 38% |
| Luxembourg | 27% |
| Estonia | 24% |

There is **no clear convergence trend** between old and new eurozone members.

**Euro adoption does not cause governments to accumulate more debt.**

### üí¨ A deeper concern: Will Bulgaria remain fiscally disciplined after joining?

One user asked:

> ‚ÄúWhat if future Bulgarian governments abuse the opportunity to take on more external debt once the currency board is removed? How do we prevent this ‚Äî especially given corruption and misuse of public funds?‚Äù
> 

This is a legitimate concern.

But I‚Äôd argue: **If a government is determined to act irresponsibly, it can do so even under the current system**.

In fact, a fiscal crisis could become the trigger for dismantling the currency board.

Seen from this angle, **joining the eurozone may actually prevent such scenarios**, by anchoring expectations and imposing additional layers of fiscal oversight.

I‚Äôll return to this question in greater depth in a future article.

### ü§ù Another source of concern: Shared debt?

Some readers worry that euro area membership might turn Bulgaria into a **solidarity debtor** ‚Äî meaning we might become liable for the debts of other eurozone members.

This perception is surprisingly common. Since it deserves focused attention, I will address it in a dedicated article later in the series.
