# #17 Protecting Bona Fide Businesses

*7 May 2025*

**A proposal to establish a hotline against administrative abuse**

During this outreach campaign, I received several reports of **administrative pressure on small businesses**. Local shop owners described excessive inspections, nitpicking over minor formalities, and unprofessional treatment by enforcement authorities.

If we allow regulators to use euro adoption as a **pretext to further harass small businesses**, we risk undermining trust, stifling entrepreneurship, and provoking open discontent. **The euro should be a symbol of freedom and opportunity, not pressure and fear.**

Medicine has a term for this: **iatrogenesis**—harm caused by the treatment itself. A doctor may act with good intentions, but interventions in a complex system like the human body can lead to unintended damage. This principle applies just as much to society and public administration.

We want state authorities to protect consumers and enforce fair practices. But instead, we risk creating a hostile environment where overzealous bureaucracy **creates unnecessary costs or drives businesses out of the market**. We must take seriously the **fragile trust** that citizens and entrepreneurs place in the state.

**Regulations must serve their true purpose**: protecting real consumer interests **without burdening honest businesses**. Excessive rigidity—especially toward small entrepreneurs—can backfire, worsening the business climate and eroding confidence among both merchants and consumers.

The true success of euro adoption will be measured by whether it **brings people more opportunities, more fairness, and more predictability**.

That is why I propose the creation of a **dedicated hotline for reporting administrative abuse** linked to euro-related regulations. Such a mechanism would allow good-faith businesses to raise concerns, ensure rapid response to misconduct, and build trust in the reform process from the very start. Most importantly, it would **establish a check on the very institutions meant to be enforcing the rules**.

If you believe this initiative is important, I encourage you to share it with policymakers, civil servants, and other stakeholders. Let's keep developing this idea—**all suggestions for more effective oversight are welcome.**
