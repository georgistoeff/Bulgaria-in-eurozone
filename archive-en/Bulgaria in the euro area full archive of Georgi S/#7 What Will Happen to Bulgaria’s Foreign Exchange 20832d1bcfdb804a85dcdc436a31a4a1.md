# #7 What Will Happen to Bulgaria’s Foreign Exchange Reserves?

**22 March 2025**

**Reader’s question:**

> “What will happen to the BNB’s foreign exchange reserves? Croatia’s dropped by almost €30 billion after they adopted the euro. Will ours disappear too?”
>

### ❗️Short Answer:

**No, Bulgaria’s reserves will not disappear. Nor did Croatia’s.**

What disappears is the **lev**, not the **wealth backing it**.

The reserves that backed the lev become part of the monetary system in its new form — the euro. The amount of wealth does not shrink; it changes form.

### 🔍 Where does the confusion come from?

It’s likely due to how we use the word **“reserve”** in everyday language versus in monetary policy.

Let’s distinguish three common meanings:

1. **Backup** — something we keep “in reserve” and don’t use unless needed (e.g. a spare tire)
2. **Stockpile** — something currently in use but also available if needed (e.g. diesel in storage tanks)
3. **Monetary Reserve** — assets (typically foreign currency) that **back a monetary liability**, like banknotes

In the case of Bulgaria’s **currency board**, every lev in circulation is backed by an equal value in euros at a fixed rate (1.95583 BGN per EUR). These **euro-denominated assets** are what the BNB holds as **foreign exchange reserves**.

Once we adopt the euro, **levs disappear** — but the **euro reserves remain**, now backing **euros in circulation**, not levs. That is not a loss; it's a transformation.

### 💬 Follow-up questions from the same reader:

> “Will we spend those reserves? Or invest them? If we’re going to spend them — can we declare that now?”
> 

### ✅ Answer:

The **Bulgarian government** may **spend its own deposits** at the BNB, subject to the **State Budget Act**. These amount to approximately **€4.2 billion**, according to the latest data.

What it **cannot spend** is the capital of the BNB or the monetary reserves that previously backed the lev — now part of the **Eurozone monetary system**.

### 📌 Clarification:

> “Can the BNB’s reserves be used to finance the Bulgarian government after eurozone accession?”
> 

**No.** Here's why:

- EU rules **prohibit monetary financing** — central banks are not allowed to fund government spending.
- The BNB **cannot increase the government’s account balances**, give **grants**, or incur liabilities on behalf of public institutions.
- This is a **foundational principle** of the European System of Central Banks, alongside central bank independence.

So, **after joining the euro**, the Bulgarian government will still be able to spend only what it **actually holds** in its **accounts at the BNB** — just as before.

### 🔁 Recap:

- The **lev disappears**, but the **wealth it represented remains**.
- Bulgaria's foreign reserves become part of the **euro-based monetary system**.
- The **government’s ability to spend** remains tied to its **account balances**, not to central bank assets.
- The BNB **cannot fund the government**, either before or after euro accession.
