# #6 Solidarity in the Eurozone / ESM / France’s Bailout

**16 March 2025**

A recurring concern I’ve received — and one echoed by other colleagues — is phrased roughly as:

> “Will we end up paying off France’s debt?”
> 

Or, more broadly:

> “Are we putting ourselves at a disadvantage by joining a system where we share responsibility for the debts of more indebted countries — especially when Bulgaria currently has one of the lowest debt levels in the EU?”
> 

---

### ❗️Short Answer:

**No — Bulgaria does not take on the debts of other euro area governments.**

There is **no joint or automatic liability** for another member state’s sovereign debt, regardless of whether that country is more indebted than Bulgaria.

---

### 📘 Where might this confusion come from?

Likely from the existence of the [**European Stability Mechanism (ESM)**](https://www.esm.europa.eu/), the eurozone’s permanent bailout fund.

When Bulgaria joins the euro area, it will also join the ESM — and this does involve a financial commitment.

### 💶 Bulgaria’s ESM Contribution — Facts

- **€833 million** — Bulgaria’s paid-in capital contribution to the ESM, spread over **12 years**
    
    (For comparison: Croatia pays over 5 years)
    
- **€6.457 billion** — Bulgaria’s **maximum callable capital**, i.e. the ceiling for future contributions if required
    
    (This is a contingency amount — not a guarantee that it will ever be used)
    
- **1% share** — Bulgaria’s proportional stake in the ESM’s total capital

The ESM has a total **subscribed capital of €708.5 billion**, of which **€81 billion** is paid-in by members.

The rest is **callable capital**, used only in exceptional circumstances.

Importantly:

> The ESM does not directly use this capital to lend money.
> 
> 
> It issues **bonds on the market**, and the capital serves as a **guarantee** for these operations.
> 

Losses would only occur if a country **borrows from the ESM and then defaults**. So far, this hasn’t happened.

### 📰 But what about a “French bailout”?

Here’s a scenario I’ve seen phrased like this (from a concerned reader of *Dnevnik*):

> “The ECB is preparing a rescue plan for France, and will force eurozone countries to bail out Paris. It may require national central banks to buy French bonds — using their gold or other assets.”
> 

Let’s unpack this.

- The **ECB cannot force** national central banks or commercial banks to buy the debt of any one country.
- France could **request support from the ESM**, but any such loan must be **repaid**.
- In extraordinary cases, the ESM may also **recapitalise banks**, but this is **rare** and highly regulated.
- If France ever needs a rescue, the scale would be **far beyond** the capacity of the ESM alone.

In that case, **joint EU institutions and the ECB would likely step in** — but this would happen regardless of Bulgaria’s status as an ESM member or not.

### 🧭 Bulgaria’s exposure — real or imagined?

Even without being in the eurozone, **Bulgaria is already affected by eurozone-wide risks**, because:

- The lev is pegged to the euro
- Eurozone inflation, deflation, and financial shocks **already spill over** into our economy
- Confidence in the euro **translates directly** into confidence in the lev

So in any major eurozone crisis, **we are already exposed** — but without the benefits or voice that come with membership.

In a full-blown crisis (e.g. France defaults), the main damage to Bulgaria would likely come not from our share in the ESM, but from:

- Euro depreciation
- Collapse in investor confidence
- A slowdown in EU-wide trade and capital flows

In other words: **we would suffer the consequences either way — but without being part of the solution**.

### 🙏 Acknowledgements

I’m grateful to two colleagues:

- **Georgi Ganev** — who first explained the workings of the ESM in detail (see his posts for more)
- **Desislava Nikolova** — who helped double-check the ESM figures and refine the technical aspects of this note

Any remaining errors or omissions are, of course, my own.
