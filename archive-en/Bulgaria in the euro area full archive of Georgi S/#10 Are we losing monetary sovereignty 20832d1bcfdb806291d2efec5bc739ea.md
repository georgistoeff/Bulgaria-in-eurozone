# #10 Are we losing monetary sovereignty?

1 April 2025

The questions I’ve received about the loss of sovereignty fall into three categories: (1) monetary policy, (2) fiscal policy, and in some cases (3) national identity. I suggest we examine each separately, starting with monetary sovereignty.

**Question:**

*Which monetary policy functions will remain with Bulgarian institutions, and which will be transferred to the ECB?*

**Answer:**

The short, non-technical answer is: the BNB already has virtually no tools for conducting independent monetary policy. This has been the case since the effective collapse of Bulgaria’s national currency in 1996–1997 and the subsequent adoption of the German mark under the currency board arrangement (and later, the euro after it replaced the mark).

So at present, we could define Bulgaria’s monetary sovereignty as follows: the only remaining power that Bulgarian society (through Parliament) holds over the money it uses is the ability to abolish the currency board and try to establish a different reserve currency—or to create a national currency once again from scratch.

This might be a meaningful option *if* there were even the slightest chance of credibility in such a newly created national currency, without being backed by the euro or another globally trusted asset. But in reality, if Bulgaria were to pursue this "sovereign" route, I expect the result would be a sharp devaluation of incomes and savings, measured in goods or in foreign currencies.

That’s why, when polling agencies ask “Do you support the euro or the lev?”, it would be more accurate to reframe the question as:

*"Would you support abolishing the currency board in order to make the lev a fully sovereign Bulgarian currency?"*

I’m not aware of any polling agency that has collected data this way—but perhaps I’ve missed something.

Adopting the euro is thus the logical and rational way out of the currency board. And paradoxically, it actually grants *more* power to the BNB. This can be interpreted as an increase in monetary sovereignty—though not in the traditional sense of national sovereignty. Rather, Bulgaria gains a seat at the table where euro area rules are shaped and applied.

Some questions expressed concern over *who* we’d be sharing this sovereignty with. For example:

*Is it not a problem that our economy is at a very different stage of development compared to Germany or France, who have much more influence over euro area monetary policy?*

**The technical answer**, as explained by the BNB, is this:

Upon joining the euro area, the Governor of the BNB will participate in the ECB’s Governing Council and vote on monetary policy decisions. The governor will have voting rights roughly 70% of the time—on par with the central bank governors of Austria, Belgium, Luxembourg, Ireland, Portugal, and others. (By comparison, governors from the five largest euro area economies vote around 80% of the time.)

**The non-technical answer** is that yes, sharing sovereignty naturally limits the freedom of national authorities. This is often why people ask, “Why don’t countries like Denmark or Sweden want to join the euro?” Many interpret euro membership as a loss of national power.

But in Bulgaria’s case, this framing doesn’t hold. We should remember: the six other EU countries outside the eurozone are not operating under a currency board. Bulgaria is the only one effectively using the euro *without* being part of its decision-making framework.

So, for us, it’s not a question of losing sovereignty—we don’t have independent monetary policy to begin with. What we gain is a voice in shaping monetary rules. Moreover, remaining outside the eurozone leaves us exposed to the *political* risk of a sudden collapse of the currency board—a very real and catastrophic scenario.

In that sense, what may look like a “loss of sovereignty” is actually a reduction of the political risk of arbitrariness and misjudgment.
