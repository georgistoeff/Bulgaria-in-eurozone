# #15 What Should Businesses Do Before 1 January 2026?

30 April 2025

In response to questions about how businesses should prepare for the euro changeover, I consulted with the technology company **Novarto**.

The transition to the euro comes with one-time costs, but with timely preparation, these efforts can turn into a **strategic investment**. Not only will you reduce future operating costs—you can also use this moment to make long-overdue improvements.

The changeover is a manageable process. With the right planning, it can be more than just a technical adjustment—it can be an opportunity for strategic renewal and increased competitiveness.

### **What needs to be updated, considering that prices must be converted to euro?**

Companies will need to adapt their **accounting systems**, **payroll modules**, **ERP systems**, **invoicing templates**, **contracts**, and **price lists**. This is especially relevant for businesses with more complex internal processes—but overall, the tasks are clear and solvable.

Price tags and service rates must be recalculated in euro. In many cases, **technical updates to online platforms** will be required—especially in areas like payments, invoicing, and pricing.

These unavoidable adjustments can be used strategically—as an opportunity to make decisions that may have been postponed, such as:

- switching to a better **payment service provider**
- updating key **ERP modules**
- or even modernizing entire business processes and IT infrastructure

### **What are the main steps for preparation? How should the transition be structured?**

Start by identifying **which systems are affected**—which ERP modules or online stores involve currency operations. Most commonly, these are:

- invoicing
- pricing
- payments
- warehouse systems (if they contain price data)
- financial reports
- bank integrations and payment gateways

Once identified, assess and plan the required changes. Then test thoroughly. If issues arise, fix them before going live.

It’s also smart to **budget for the transition**. You may need extra resources for software updates, legal advice, and staff training.

### **Are there direct benefits to doing all this?**

Yes—these are **one-time costs**. In the long run, businesses will recoup the investment through **lower operational expenses**.

One of the most tangible benefits will be **reduced transaction costs**—fewer banking and conversion fees on cross-border transfers and international deals.

Working with clients and partners across the eurozone will be more intuitive—not just due to a common currency, but also thanks to streamlined accounting and admin processes. This is especially helpful when using **SaaS platforms**, paying for **software licenses**, running **online ads**, etc., which are often billed in euro.

Online sales within the eurozone are also expected to become easier, as consumers prefer to shop in their own currency.

With the removal of the need for **currency conversion** between BGN and EUR, many software systems—payment platforms, online stores, ERPs—can simplify or remove exchange rate modules altogether. While this is not a radical change, it contributes to operational efficiency.

### **Do we need to amend all contracts that specify amounts in BGN?**

No. There is **no need to update all contracts explicitly**. The law will ensure that all amounts in BGN are automatically converted to euro at the **fixed exchange rate (1 EUR = 1.95583 BGN)** on the changeover date. This is an **ex lege conversion**—i.e., it happens automatically by law, without needing consent or additional action from either party.

Still, this may be a good moment to **review and update contracts** gradually—especially those due for renewal or renegotiation, or those that are important for long-term relationships with partners.
