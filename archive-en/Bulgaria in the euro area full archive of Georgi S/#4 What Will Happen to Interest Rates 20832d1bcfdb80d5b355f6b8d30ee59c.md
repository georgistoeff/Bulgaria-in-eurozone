# #4 What Will Happen to Interest Rates?

**8 March 2025**

Questions about interest rates after Bulgaria’s entry into the euro area typically fall into two categories:

1. What will happen to **interest rates on existing loans**?
2. How will **interest rates on new loans** behave after 1 January 2026?

### 🏦 **1. What happens to interest rates on existing loans?**

This issue is addressed in the Law on the Introduction of the Euro in the Republic of Bulgaria (the “Euro Law”), which explicitly covers both fixed and variable interest rates.

- **For fixed-rate loans**, the situation is straightforward:
    
    Banks **cannot unilaterally change** a loan agreement due to the currency switch.
    
    The interest rate remains exactly the same, simply expressed in euros instead of leva.
    
- **For variable-rate loans**, the mechanism is more complex — but the principle is similar.
    
    These loans are structured as:
    
    > Reference rate + risk premium
    > 
    > 
    > For example:
    > 
    > If the reference rate is **1%**, and the risk premium is **2%**, the total interest rate is **3%**.
    > 
    > If the reference rate later rises to **3%**, the total becomes **5%**.
    > 
    
    Under the Euro Law, **banks are required to adjust their reference rates** such that the resulting euro-denominated interest payments remain equivalent to what they would have been in leva at the moment of conversion.
    
    In other words: **the change in currency does not affect the interest rate**.
    
    🔍 Let me be as clear as possible:
    
    **Variable interest rates may rise**, but **not because of the euro**.
    
    If the reference rate increases, your rate will go up — exactly as it would have in the current system.

### 🧠 A personal note:

A long period of low interest rates can give people the illusion that they’ll stay that way forever.

I always advise borrowers to **simulate what would happen** if their interest rate were to double — for example, from 3% to 6%.

Use any loan calculator to see how your monthly payment would change.

If that scenario would put pressure on your finances, consider **prepaying part of the principal** if possible.

### 📈 **2. What about interest rates on new loans after 1 January 2026?**

This question sits at the intersection between **personal finance** and **macroeconomic stability** — a theme I’ll explore further in the next articles.

So far, I’ve received two types of concerns:

### 🟠 Scenario A: Interest rates will rise because banks adopt EURIBOR

This concern is plausible.

Many eurozone banks use **EURIBOR** (e.g. 3-month Euribor, currently ~2.5%) as their reference rate.

In contrast, **Bulgarian banks today use benchmarks close to 0%**, which would make a switch to EURIBOR appear as an increase.

While EURIBOR is not mandatory, it is likely to replace local references over time.

### 🟢 Scenario B: Interest rates will fall due to lower reserve requirements

This concern also makes sense.

After euro adoption, banks’ reserve requirements drop from **12% to 1%**, which could increase liquidity and keep interest rates low.

More money in the system might encourage lending — but other factors will also play a role.

### 🧮 So, which scenario is more likely?

Both are legitimate and grounded in sound reasoning.

That said, I won’t make a prediction about interest rates in 2027 (or even 2026).

If I had to guess, I’d say rates **probably won’t go lower**, but **how much higher** and **when** — that’s unclear.

The **Bulgarian National Bank** has offered one forecast that I find logical:

They expect total banking reserves held at the BNB to remain stable.

The explanation involves a monetary policy instrument called the **deposit facility**, which you can explore here:

### 🧩 Final thought:

Yes — risks and challenges exist. But they **should not be automatically blamed on euro adoption**.

When we analyze future risks in a macroeconomic context, we should also keep in mind the **current risks** we face **outside** the euro area.

That is the topic I’ll begin to explore next — in a new section of this series focused on **macroeconomic stability and sovereignty**.
