# #20 The Toughest Lesson (and a Thank You)

*24 May 2025*

I hope this newsletter will remain a resource for those seeking not just to understand *what* we decided, but *how* we thought when we made that decision. More than that, I hope that everything written here can one day be tested, debated — even refuted.

That is the power of reason: not in being infallible, but in being open to correction. We can disprove, but rarely prove.

Like the search for truth, the fight for freedom, justice, and the rule of law is one of those human efforts where **failure is visible, but success is invisible**.

When we *have* freedom, we don't talk about it.

When we *start talking* about freedom, we’re likely already at risk of losing it.

Perhaps the hardest lesson is this: freedom does not demand reciprocity.

In *my* world — a world of open societies and democratic procedures — I will defend the right of someone to speak *against* those very values.

In *his* world — where order is utopian and truth is absolute — I won’t be able to speak at all.

Not of freedom, not of doubt, not of choice.

But **freedom is not a deal**. It does not expect symmetry.

Justice, likewise, does not always require reciprocity.

And so, our institutional choices are not merely pragmatic — they are **acts of loyalty to freedom**, even when reciprocity is absent.

I launched this campaign on **23 February 2025**, setting an end date of **1 June 2025**.

From day one, many friends, colleagues, and journalists stood by me. I owe each of you my deepest gratitude.

Of course, all errors, omissions, and missed opportunities are entirely my own.

In rough chronological order, thank you to:

**Alexandrina Stoeva, Georgi Ganev, Desislava Nikolova, Miroslav Turiski, Spas Bakurov, Valentina Kutseva, Krasen Stanchev, Ruslan Stefanov, Tanya Ilieva, Velislava Popova, Zhivka Tancheva, Vyara Zheleva, Emilia Milcheva, Veselin Dremdzhiev, Ivaylo Lakov, Marta Mladenova, Svetla Kostadinova, Alexander Krastev, Yovko Lambrev, Borislav Minkov, Ivo Eftimov, Svetoslav Malinov, Juliet Mandazhieva, Ivan Dimitrov, Kalin Manolov** — who kindly invited me to speak on *The Alternative* more than once; I regret not making the time.

A special thanks to **Miroslav Petkov** from **ABB Bookshops in Pleven**, who was the first to display prices in euros after my call. I had hoped larger retail chains might lead by example and begin dual pricing — in BGN and euros — *before* the legal requirement.

None did. A small gesture, perhaps, but a revealing one.

The most important decisions aren’t always made in office — some are made at the counter, at the keyboard, in everyday life.

And finally, thank you to *all of you who asked hard questions*, and to *all of you who shared the answers*.
