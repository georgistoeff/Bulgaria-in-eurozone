# #14 Fiscal Sovereignty or Citizen Sovereignty?

27 April 2025

This post is for a specific group of readers who have asked about the potential loss of *fiscal sovereignty*. It’s worth noting that most macroeconomic concerns I’ve received actually go in the opposite direction: that the government might lose fiscal **prudence** because it would gain more freedom—more “fiscal sovereignty”?—to spend taxpayers’ money and accumulate debt.

At the same time, a smaller group of readers raised a different concern, which I can summarize with this question:

**Question:**

*“Assuming that most of the eurozone countries we consider rich live with significant public debt—and there have been no revolutions—then this debt must have been wisely invested. Doesn’t this mean that we too should catch up by prudently issuing and investing debt? After all, the ECB’s policies are aimed at stability and largely shaped by the bigger economies.”*

**Answer:**

The logic goes: rich countries have debt, their citizens enjoy high living standards, so clearly that debt was well spent. Can’t we do the same?

This is a fair and rational question. While its assumptions are not backed by a strong consensus in economic theory, it touches on a fundamental issue:

**Are Bulgaria’s institutions and rule of law strong enough to ensure that any public debt issued will be managed wisely?**

The surprising truth is that this answer doesn’t start with economics. It starts with something deeper: the **rule of law** and the **protection of individual liberty**—which is the real meaning of “sovereignty.”

### What is real sovereignty?

Traditionally, *national sovereignty* refers to a state's right to govern itself without external interference.

But in a free society, sovereignty has two essential layers:

- 🛡️ **External sovereignty** – independence from foreign powers
- ⚖️ **Internal sovereignty** – protection of citizens from their *own* government, through constitutional limits and the rule of law

**True national sovereignty derives from individual sovereignty.** It exists to serve the freedom of citizens—not the power of the state. A constitution doesn’t merely organize government—it *restrains* it, in order to protect the individual.

### What does the “rule of law” really mean?

In the official translation of EU treaties, *rule of law* appears as *правова държава* (“law-governed state”) in Bulgarian.

But as economist Krasen Stanchev noted in [this 2024 analysis](https://www.svobodnaevropa.bg/a/evrozona-pravni-osnovania-balagaria/33006887.html), this translation—though formally correct—risks diluting the term’s deeper meaning.

**The rule of law means that no one—not even the government—is above the law.** The law exists to protect the liberty of individuals, not to serve the convenience of rulers.

This principle is foundational to the European Union and is enshrined in the **Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU).**

---

### The TFEU enhances sovereignty in three key ways:

1. **Common standards** – fundamental rights are not left solely to national governments
2. **Dual protection** – citizens can seek justice at both national and European levels
3. **Global leverage** – united, countries can defend their interests more effectively

Thus, the EU is a union of **sovereign citizens and sovereign nations**, choosing to protect their freedom *together*, not in isolation.

**Sovereignty that begins with the liberty of the individual is not lost in a union—it is strengthened.**

In this light, the *loss* of “fiscal sovereignty” by a government with poor discipline may in fact mean a *gain* in **citizen sovereignty**: the ability of individuals and businesses to plan their lives under more predictable, rules-based conditions.

---

### Principles vs. reality

Of course, these are principled ideas. Their application in Bulgaria’s political context is not guaranteed—and is indeed fraught with risk.

As I’ve written in earlier posts about budget discipline, Bulgaria—inside or outside the eurozone—remains vulnerable to **fiscal recklessness**.

These risks are made worse by the illusion that Bulgaria is entering the eurozone as a **mature democracy governed by the rule of law**.

### A question no one asked—but should

Let me close with the question I personally find most important—though no one has yet asked it:

**Will joining the eurozone weaken the pressure for internal reform in Bulgaria?**

Will we lose one of the few remaining levers that push our institutions toward **justice**, **accountability**, and **freedom**?

What happens if we are admitted largely for geopolitical reasons—having formally checked the boxes of a democratic legal state, but not in substance?

Will we remain stuck in that formalism?

Or will we find the internal strength to become a **sustainable democracy**?

And isn’t it dangerously naive to treat **defense against external threats** and **defense of the rule of law** as if they were separate tasks?
