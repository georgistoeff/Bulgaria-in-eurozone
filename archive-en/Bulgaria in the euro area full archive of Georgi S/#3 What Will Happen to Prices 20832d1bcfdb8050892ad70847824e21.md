# #3 What Will Happen to Prices?

**4 March 2025**

Here, I group together several questions I’ve received about how prices might change after Bulgaria adopts the euro. While the questions vary widely, they share a common concern: will life become more expensive?

---

### 💬 Will prices double — just switching the currency symbol?

No. Euro adoption is not just a change of currency symbol — it's a formal **redenomination** of all prices at the fixed rate of **1 EUR = 1.95583 BGN**.

This applies to prices, wages, and any other monetary values. A price of 1.00 BGN becomes **0.51 EUR**, not 1.00 EUR.

---

### 💬 Will rounding lead to price increases?

Rounding can cause small upward adjustments, especially for low-value items.

For example, a coffee that costs **3 BGN** converts to **1.53 EUR**. A retailer might round it to **1.60 EUR**, which is a **4–5% increase**. This may happen in some cases, but the overall effect is limited.

---

### 💬 Will retailers use the euro as an excuse to raise prices?

Some may try — but this is not likely to become a systemic issue. **In competitive markets**, unjustified price hikes are quickly punished by customers and competitors.

Where competition is weak or distorted, price abuses can happen **with or without the euro** — and often already do.

---

### 💬 How can we monitor price changes?

The **National Statistical Institute** will continue publishing the **Consumer Price Index (CPI)**.

However, each person or household experiences price changes differently, depending on their personal "basket" of goods and services.

If you want to track changes more closely, you can compare receipts from supermarkets before and after the euro.

Some countries offer **citizen-driven platforms** for tracking price changes, though I’m not aware of one in Bulgaria at the moment.

### 💬 How can I know if a price increase is due to the euro?

This is a key question — and a difficult one.

Prices fluctuate constantly, no matter the currency. If you want to understand real causes, here are some approaches:

- **Long-term trends**: Prices for services (like haircuts or hotels) tend to rise due to increased wages or labor costs. If that trend continues post-euro, the euro itself may not be the reason.
- **International comparisons**: If the price of a good rises in Bulgaria but also in countries that don’t use the euro, it’s likely a global factor (e.g. energy, transport).
- **Regulated prices**: Water or electricity tariffs are often political decisions. If they rise, it’s almost certainly due to regulation, not the euro.
- **Data from other countries**: Look at price trends in countries that joined the euro before Bulgaria — and compare with those that didn’t.

In short: before blaming the euro, rule out other major factors.

### 💬 Have some prices already started to rise in anticipation?

Yes, this is possible. Some sellers may raise prices early, expecting people to assume inflation is coming.

But Bulgaria has already experienced significant inflation in recent years — due to **global shocks**, not euro adoption.

So it’s hard to separate motives. Still, **competition works**: unfair increases rarely last long.

---

### 💬 Why doesn’t the government freeze prices to prevent inflation?

Price controls may sound appealing, but they usually lead to **shortages**, especially of essential goods.

Monitoring and enforcement are possible in theory, but in practice — especially in less mature democracies — these measures often do more harm than good. They **distort markets** and end up hurting consumers.

---

### 💬 When will prices be shown in both leva and euros?

According to the **Bulgarian National Bank**, **dual price display** becomes mandatory **one month after** the official EU decision approving Bulgaria’s euro membership.

That said, I see no reason why retailers — especially large supermarket chains — couldn’t start earlier voluntarily. It would be a positive signal.

---

### 💬 What are the rules for rounding converted prices?

The **official exchange rate** (1.95583) must be applied in full, **without shortening or approximation**.

Then:

- The amount is rounded to **two decimal places (cents)** based on the **third decimal digit**:
    - If the third digit is **less than 5**, the amount is rounded **down**.
    - If it is **5 or more**, it is rounded **up**.

🔍 For example:

If a loaf of bread costs **1.70 BGN**, it converts to **0.8693 EUR**

→ This becomes **0.87 EUR** on the price label.
