Introduction

In early 2025, as Bulgaria approached a pivotal moment in its path toward euro adoption, I made a personal decision to contribute to the public conversation — not through formal reports or policy papers, but by directly addressing people’s questions, concerns, and fears.

For three months, I answered inquiries about the euro in a weekly public newsletter, published on LinkedIn, and mirrored in a series of social media posts and personal messages. The project was entirely pro bono. It was not commissioned or sponsored by any institution. It was simply an attempt to meet confusion with clarity — and apathy with care.

This archive collects those writings, organized in roughly the order in which I sensed public priorities were shifting. The early pieces deal with the most frequent and emotionally charged questions: Will prices go up? Will salaries change? Will Bulgaria lose control over its economy? Later texts tackle more systemic topics, such as fiscal rules, monetary sovereignty, and institutional trust.

Alongside these publications, I worked to promote one simple and practical idea: that early voluntary dual pricing (in both leva and euros) by major retailers could reduce anxiety and disinformation far more effectively than official campaigns. Some embraced this — most didn’t, until the last possible moment.

By the end of the campaign, as political rhetoric intensified and disinformation attacks mounted, it became clear that facts alone were not enough. But facts, when presented clearly, calmly, and consistently, still matter. They shape the space in which democratic choices are made — and prevent worse futures from unfolding.

This archive is not an argument for the euro. It is a record of what happens when a society asks real questions — and someone tries to answer them.
